## Why SpankBang Downloader

SpankBang uses player-driven media delivery that can expose multiple sources and qualities depending on page state. Generic tools may miss the active stream or surface unrelated assets instead of the actual video playback source.

SpankBang Downloader is built to reduce that friction. Open the video, let the extension detect the supported media source, choose the quality you want, and export the result as MP4.

## Features

- Detects supported SpankBang video sources from watch pages
- Lists available resolutions when multiple variants exist (240p through 1080p or higher)
- In-page download button built into the video player
- Converts HLS streams to downloadable MP4 files in-browser
- Right-click context menu for a faster download flow
- Real-time progress tracking with download speed and file size
- Desktop notifications when downloads complete
- Exports MP4 files for easier replay and archiving
- Supports desktop and mobile SpankBang URLs (m.spankbang.com)
- Cross-browser support for Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Firefox, Whale, and Yandex

## Supported Formats

## Who It's For

- SpankBang viewers who want offline copies of supported videos
- Users who prefer a browser extension over manual extraction
- People archiving videos they already have access to
- Users who want a simple MP4 download workflow
- Anyone who wants to avoid command-line tools or desktop software for downloads

## Common Use Cases

- Save a SpankBang video for later viewing
- Export the highest available quality as MP4
- Avoid manually tracing player source URLs
- Keep local copies for offline playback
- Download the best quality exposed by the page

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not detect the video**
Start playback first and wait for the page to fully initialize the active stream.

**Only one source appears**
Some pages expose only one usable source, so only one option may be available.

**The detected source seems wrong**
Refresh the page and retry after playback starts again.

**The download stopped or failed partway through**
Check whether your internet connection dropped during the export. Retry the download from the popup.

**The page requires account access**
The extension only works on media you can already open and play in your active browser session.
